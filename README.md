# Arcpy-K-Means
Implement k-means clustering algorithm in ArcGIS

There are quite limited machine learning algorithms in ArcGIS pro but not in basic ArcGIS. To fill the gap, I came up with the idea that making some ArcTools based on Python scripts that introduce data mining into ArcGIS.

The idea is quite simple. Using Arcpy to get the values in attribute table and storing them into arrays, then you can use these arrays as the input to k-means clustering algorithm.

I referred to other's code for k-means clustering algorithm. Sorry for the original author of that piece of code because I cannot remember who I referred to.
